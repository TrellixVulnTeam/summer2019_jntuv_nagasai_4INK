<h1> Embedding images in a html page</h1>
<hr/>
<!--
You have a images/ladybug.jpg file that you have to use for the exercises below.
Q1: What are the dimensions of that image?
Q2:
1. Use the orginal image but make the browser display it as 120x90 pixels
2. Resize it to images/ladybug-120-90.jpg (120x90 pixels) and use it to display the same again.
3. If the browser can resize the image, why bother creating smaller versions of the images? Hint: compare sizes.

Imagine what would happen if you display the original images in a gallery of products.

How to create the thumbnail.

1. Create the smaller versions using ms paint at first.
2. Use the PIL library and write a python script to do the same :-).
